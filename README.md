### Hello everyone ðŸ‘‹

I am Adwaith, currently working as a software engineer at Cisco Systems, Bangalore. I am part of Cisco's MIG(Mass-Scale Infrastructure Group) security team. I graduated with a BTech in Computer Science and Engineering from National Institute of Technology Karnataka, batch of 2020.

I explored offensive security during my college days - vulnerabilities, exploitation methods, reverse engineering, writing security tools etc., This was limited to the userspace and kernelspace. Offlate, I am exploring stuff related to Pre-OS state - BIOS, UEFI, Firmware, Firmware security and analysis, Reversing firmware etc., Apart from this, I have also spent some time understanding TPM, concept of Root-of-Trust, Formal logic and Solvers.

I blog [here](https://www.pwnthebox.net/).

- I am currently trying to understand the pre-OS state better. Understand BIOS, UEFI, learning to analyze firmware and more.
- I am fascinated by Rustlang. I experiment with it and compare it with C. I have documented some findings [here](https://www.pwnthebox.net/rust/2020/10/11/rust-c-experiments.html).
- Want to learn more about Solvers, Symbolic execution, program analysis. Suggestions on books/resources are welcome.
