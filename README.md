### Hello everyone ðŸ‘‹

I am Adwaith, currently a Business student at the ESCP Business School in the Master in Management programme. I am part of MDI Gurgaon's PGDM-IB programme. At the moment, a few fields that interest me are Operations Management, Logistics, Supply Chain Management, Aviation & Airport Management and Finance. I am interested/intend to understand and solve interesting business problems in these fields using Operations Research, Quantitative Methods, Machine Learning.

Previously, I worked at Cisco Systems Bangalore as a software engineer for about 4 years. I was part of Cisco's MIG (Mass-Scale Infrastructure Group) security team. It was a router security team for the MIG vertical which sold carrier grade routers (routers for service-providers like Airtel, Jio, AT&T, Verizon etc., and data-center customers like Google, Facebook, Amazon etc.,). I graduated with a Bachelor in Technology in Computer Science and Engineering from the National Institute of Technology Karnataka, batch of 2020.

I was fascinated with Computer Systems and Security and spent a solid 6 years of my life in that field, 2 as a student exploring the field and 4 working in the field. I have blogged on various subjects of Computer Security extensively back in the time, you can find them [here](https://www.agautham.io/archive/), in case you are interested.

I joined a good B-School in India in June 2024 and am a full-time management student. At the moment, I am in Europe for my exchange year. I have taken up AI and Big Data for Business Innovation for Business Innovation as my specialization. So let us see how it goes!

That is about me.

Cheers,
Adwaith
