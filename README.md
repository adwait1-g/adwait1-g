### Hello everyone ðŸ‘‹

I am Adwaith, currently an M1 Business student at the ESCP Business School in the Master in Management programme. I am interested in using AI, ML, analytics to solve interesting business problems, and I am always on the look for a good challenge!

Previously, I worked at Cisco Systems Bangalore as a software engineer for about 4 years. I was part of Cisco's MIG (Mass-Scale Infrastructure Group) security team. It was a router security team for the MIG vertical which sold carrier grade routers (routers for service-providers like Airtel, Jio, AT&T, Verizon etc., and data-center customers like Google, Facebook, Amazon etc.,). I graduated with a Bachelor in Technology in Computer Science and Engineering from the National Institute of Technology Karnataka, batch of 2020. Have good experience in programming in C and Python, building data models and pipelines along with development of network security protocols.

I have been fascinated with Computer Systems for a long time now. I spent a solid 6 years in the field of Cybersecurity, 2 as a student reading research papers, writing summaries, doing implementations and improvements and 4 working in the field building security solutions at scale. I have blogged on Computer Science extensively, you can find there [here](https://www.agautham.io/cybersecurity/).

That is about me. You can checkout my website [agautham.io](https://agautham.io/) for more interesting stuff.

Cheers,
Adwaith
